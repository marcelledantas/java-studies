Database: public Book lookup(String isbn)

WebService: public Book lookup(String isbn)

First, call the method that connects to the db, if that does not return anything, then call the method that connects to the webService.
Goal: to test which one of this method did or did not get called.
Finding out if a method is called or not is known as testing behavior.
Did our code behave the way that we expected?
Did a method that we expected to run actually run?
Or did a method that we expected would not run, not run?
In this case, we are testing code flow, not just if we get the right values out.
