Tautology: it is a repetition of the test code on the code that we are testing.
One of the ways to avoid tautologies: test shouldn't include any logic.
The tests should be base on examples and expected outcome. You don't have to calculate anything in your test code. If it is, it means that the test isn't right,
there's a great chance that the test won't work properly.

We are doing tests based on TDD all the test should be based on examples where you know the expected outcome. You shouldn't calculate expected outcomes in a test.
