My notes from Practical Test-Driven Development for Java Programmers - LinkedIn Course

1 - Test the expected outcome of an example.
"I expected this particularly example to result in the following outcome"
2 - Don't pre-judge design...let your tests drive it
3 - Write the minimum code required to get your tests to pass
4 - Each test should validate one single piece of logic

TDD Concepts:
IMPORTANT: Write the minimum of code possible to make the test (that previously failed) pass.
